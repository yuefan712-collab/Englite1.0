## 📖 What is EngLite?

**EngLite 3.0** is an open-source protocol that refactors English orthography into a logical, 1:1 phonetic system. 

Current English spelling is a 500-year-old "legacy code" full of technical debt (silent letters, irregular verbs, ambiguous phonemes). EngLite acts as a **system patch**, optimizing the language for:
1.  **Human Efficiency:** Reduces decoding time by 90%.
2.  **Accessibility:** Solves the root cause of orthographic Dyslexia.
3.  **Machine Logic:** Lowers entropy for NLP and LLM tokenization.

We are not simplifying the *meaning*; we are optimizing the *rendering*.
